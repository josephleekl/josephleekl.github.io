I work at the intersection of Physics, High Performance Computing, and Machine Learning. Right now, I focus on developing and optimizing [open-source software for quantum computing and quantum machine learning](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane).

In the past, among [other things](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HbvtvZsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), I've worked on:

- building a [distributed quantum simulator](https://pennylane.ai/devices/lightning-kokkos) for HPC systems like [Frontier](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)>),
- exploring [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) architecture [for HPC](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-40843-4_31),
- using [OpenMP offload for hybrid quantum-classical simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03210),
- studying the [energy efficiency and sustainability of AI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10820628) on supercomputers, and
- simulating [quantum field theories](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.221601) and [holographic cosmological models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13867) of the very early universe.

I received my [Ph.D.](http://dx.doi.org/10.7488/era/2921) in Theoretical Physics from [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I received my Masters in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics and Bachelors in Physics and Philosophy at [the University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, quizzing, climbing rocks, and pampering my two cats. Here's [me in another life.](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lee_(poet)>)
