abstract:  In the holographic approach to cosmology, cosmological observables are described in terms of correlators of a three-dimensional boundary quantum field theory. As a concrete model, we study the 3D massless SU(N) scalar matrix field theory with a ϕ^4 interaction. On the lattice, the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) in this theory can mix with the operator ϕ^2. We utilize the Wilson Flow to renormalize the EMT on the lattice, and present numerical results for the mixing coefficient for N=2. Obtaining the renormalized EMT will allow us to make predictions for the CMB power spectra in the regime where the dual QFT is non-perturbative.
