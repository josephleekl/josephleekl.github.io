In order to obtain cosmological observables, correlators of this QFT may be obtained via lattice field theory. Previous work has focused on scalar œï^4 matrix theories in the adjoint representation of SU(N). In this work we present preliminary results in the critical behaviour and phase structure of the theory with an SU(N) scalar field coupled to gauge fields by utilising the Heatbath-Overrelaxation (HBOR) algorithm in lattice field theory.","tags":[],"title":"Critical behaviour and phase structure of 3d Scalar+Gauge Field Theories in the adjoint representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joseph K.

The ability of the Wilson flow to eliminate divergent contact terms makes it a practical method for renormalizing the energy-momentum tensor on the lattice. In this paper, we utilize the Wilson flow to define a procedure to renormalize the energy-momentum tensor for a three-dimensional massless scalar field in the adjoint of SU(N) with a œÜ4 interaction on the lattice.

A bare mass is required for the theory to be massless at the quantum level. In perturbation theory the critical mass is ambiguous due to infrared (IR) divergences and we indeed find that at two-loops in lattice perturbation theory the critical mass diverges logarithmically. It was conjectured long ago in [Jackiw 1980, Appelquist 1981] that super-renormalisable theories are nonperturbatively IR finite, with the coupling constant playing the role of an IR regulator. Using a combination of Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo simulations of the lattice-regularised theory, both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis, and considerations of a corresponding effective theory we gather evidence that this is indeed the case.","tags":[],"title":"Nonperturbative infrared finiteness in super-renormalisable scalar quantum field theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joseph K.
